# Stack Memory Allocator
Based on public domain code by `Eli Bendersky (eliben at gmail.com)`.

Changes added By - Bhathiya Perera AKA JaDogg. ðŸŒž

### Why?
Pretend to use heap memory while using a stack allocated fixed size (during compile time) block of memory.

### Usage
1. Rename `malloc` etc to functions provided here using something like `#define malloc stmmr_malloc`.
2. For libraries you use override appropriate `#define`s and point them to `stmmr_xxx` functions. 
3. Do not mix with any other allocator's allocated memory.
4. Available methods. `stmmr_malloc`, `stmmr_free`, `stmmr_realloc`, `stmmr_calloc`.


### Tiny modifications added.
1. `stmmr_free` does not continue if pointer is `NULL`.
2. Uses `stdint.h` for unsigned data types. This is now therefore need `C99`.
3. Added `stmmr_realloc(p, size)`.
  * This uses the hidden header allocated behind the pointer to get the size of current memory block. 
5. Added `stmmr_calloc(num, size)`.
6. Added data type `stmmr_int_t`. 
7. Single header implementation. `#define STMMR_IMPL` in one `C` file before including `stmmr.h`. For other files just include `stmmr.h`
